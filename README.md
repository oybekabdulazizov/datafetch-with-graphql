# datafetch-with-graphql - React App

## Desctription 

This project highlights pulling data from a grapqhl API and demonstrating a randomly requested number of countries.

In order to run the project, clone the repository to your local machine using your fav terminal. 

### `git clone https://github.com/oybekabdulazizov/datafetch-with-graphql.git`

Head into the project folder and run the below command: 

### `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` 

Once complete, please check the npm install command and make sure it completed with no errors. 

Then run: 

### `npm start` 

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

## Patience

This project requires you to be a little patient while the app is running in your browser as 
fetching the data can be a little slow. 
I have tried catching all the errors, but there are some really annoying ones ðŸ¥²

When you choose a continent, select the number of countries to show up, and hit Submit, 
the app may take a while to show you the fetched data. 
Or it won't and just gets stuck there or throws some nice looking error to your face. Sorry in advance. 

A proper workaround would be to just refresh the page, and repeat the steps again. A couple or 3-4 more times ðŸ˜„
